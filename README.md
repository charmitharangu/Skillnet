This project falls under Educational Technology and aims to
enhance communication between students and faculty.
The web-based platform allows students to ask questions
directly to lecturers, with automatic email notifications and
shared responses in a public forum.
Features like Ask Question, My Questions, Forum, Faculty,
and Groups foster collaboration, improve accessibility, and
support interactive, community-based learning.
